Query Performance Improvements:

The partitioned table shows significant improvement for date-range queries
Only relevant partitions are scanned, reducing I/O operations
Parallel processing of partitions is possible
Index scans are more efficient within smaller partitions
Specific Benefits:
Reduced execution time for date-filtered queries
Better memory utilization
Improved cache hit rates
More efficient index usage
